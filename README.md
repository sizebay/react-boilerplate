# Sizebay React Boilerplate

This boilerplate covers our React front-end environment, from Fev. 2019 and beyond.

## Features

Our starter pack consists of:

- React Hooks
- Context API
- Styled Components
- Customized props and behaviours

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, after running **`npm install`** (only for the first time), you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

As of this moment, we're using the default CRA build rules which are available via webpack. We do plan to change some rules in the future though.
